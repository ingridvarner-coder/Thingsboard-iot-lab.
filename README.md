A beginner security project exploring IoT, device onboarding, rule-chains & monitoring.

Author: Ingrid Varner
Purpose: Document my journey learning how IoT platforms manage devices, accounts, and security controls while practicing hands-on skills with ThingsBoard.
Status: Completed as part of my Security+ learning labs.

🔥 Why I Built This

I’m early in my cybersecurity journey, and I wanted to understand how IoT devices actually connect, authenticate, and send data in real environments.
This project shows that I’m:

eager to learn,

not afraid to troubleshoot,

and able to follow technical workflows from start to finish.

This lab was completed in NDG NetLab+, and all screenshots in the /screenshots folder follow the strict lab documentation rules (annotated, labeled, timestamped).

 What I Learned
✔ Starting and managing the ThingsBoard IoT service

I launched the ThingsBoard server inside the lab environment and learned how the dashboard, alarms, and device panels work.

✔ Creating and configuring multiple user accounts

I practiced setting up different roles, learning how organizations typically structure access and permissions.

✔ Adding and connecting an IoT device to the platform

I created a new device, configured its metadata, and saw how real IoT devices communicate with the backend.

✔ Building a Rule Chain to process incoming data

This showed me how events become alarms, telemetry, and user notifications.

✔ Troubleshooting connection issues

My alarm didn’t show up the first few attempts, even though the terminal said it was running.
I learned to reset, restart, and verify configs until it finally displayed correctly.

Lab Summary (from the original assignment)

I learned how to use the ThingsBoard service by starting the IoT platform, creating different user accounts, and connecting a simulated IoT device to the system. At first, I struggled because my alarm wasn’t showing up even though the terminal said everything was working. I ended up restarting the lab and redoing some steps until it finally appeared. This helped me understand not only the workflow but also how important troubleshooting is in cybersecurity and IoT environments.

I also added a rule chain and tested the new device to make sure it communicated properly. By the end of the lab, I successfully managed accounts, set up the device, and verified its telemetry. This project showed me how IoT devices are monitored, how data flows through rule chains, and how administrators manage access and system behavior. Most importantly. it helped me build the confidence to keep learning more about IoT security.
